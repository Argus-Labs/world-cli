## World CLI

World CLI is a swiss army knife for creating, managing, and deploying World Engine projects.

Key features include:

- **Create** — Initialize a new World Engine project based on [starter-game-template](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template)
- **Dev Mode** — Run your game shard in dev mode (with editor support) for fast iteration
- **[Soon] Deploy** — Get a prod-ready World Engine deployment in the cloud easier than deploying a smart contract.
